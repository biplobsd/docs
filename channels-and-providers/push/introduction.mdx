Push notifications are short, targeted messages delivered to a user's device or browser, often through mobile apps or websites. They serve as a powerful communication tool, offering real-time updates, reminders, and personalized content. Push notifications can range from news alerts and social media updates to promotional offers and important app notifications.

These messages are designed to engage users and keep them informed about relevant events or activities, even when they are not actively using an app or browsing a website. They play a crucial role in user engagement and retention for businesses and organizations, as they can re-engage users and prompt them to take specific actions.

Novu can be used to deliver push notifications to your customers devices using a unified delivery API. Both Mobile and Web push notifications are supported.
